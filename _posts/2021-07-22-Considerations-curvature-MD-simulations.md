Some points to keep in mind to calculate membrane curvature from MD simulations.

---------------------------


Molecular Dynamics(MD) simulations are a powerful tool to study biological
systems at the molecular level of detail. Over the last decades, biomolecular
systems investigated via MD simulations have gained an incredibly high
complexity while extending to the microseconds and even milisecond time-scale.
The remarkable flexibility to reproduce realistic biomolecular systems, together
with the ability to perform analysis over long time scales while keeping track
of physico-chemical interactions, makes of MD one of the most popular tools
across different fields of science and engineering.

Lipid bilayers play a pivotal role in in biological systems. By providing
specific biophysical properties, lipids confer structure and unique physical
properties to the bilayer [[1]]. Such physical properties strongly relate to their
biological function, and to make everything even more interesting, the
composition of each cellular membrane has evolved to optimize the functions
associated with it. This makes of MD simulations of lipid bilayers, in broad
ranges of lipid composition and size, is one of the most common MD setups in
biomolecular systems.

However, biological membranes are not purely a lipid
barrier. They also contain up to 50 % protein by mass (up to 50 %!) [[2]] . Membrane
proteins are critical components in the biology of the cell. Several studies support
that interactions between proteins and their lipid environment may influence the
stability and function. This makes of MD simulations of membrane-protein systems
a very common approach.

MD simulations produce high volumes of data that also requires exhaustive
analysis and statistics. Since our main goal is to develop a tool to calculate
membrane curvature, we should look at the problem from different perspectives.
In the first part of this series, I will describe some important points to
consider when developing analysis tools to calculate membrane curvature from MD
simulations. 

Together with Numpy, the foundation of this cool `MembraneCurvature` tool is [MDAnalysis]. 
In the following considerations I will use the names of key data structures and concepts from
[MDAnalysis].

# Considerations (Part I)

At the most fundamental escenario, we have two possible MD simulations setups:

**1.1 Membrane only.** <br>
and <br>
**1.2 Membrane-protein.**

Simultaneously, in membrane-protein systems, we can identify two
types of setups:


**1.2.1. Protein with positions restraints:** <br>
The protein is fixed: neither translates nor rotates.

**1.2.2. Protein with no position restraints:** <br>
The protein diffuses in the lipid bilayer and is free to translate and rotates.

Figure 1 shows a diagram that summarizes the most common system setups in MD.

width = "650"/>


In one category, we can put together two types of setups: **1.1 Membrane only** 
systems and **1.2.1 Membrane protein systems and Protein with positions restraints**. 

In both cases, we don't need further trajectory processing. Instead, what we
need is to treat all the atoms that fall outside the boundaries of our
simulation box in the `n_frames` of the trajectory. We can manage these 
jumpy atoms by using the [MDAnalysis.transformations.wrap].

This is a schematic example of how wrapped coordinates look like:

Then, when calculating membrane curvature in `mda.Universes` that comprises
membrane only (**case 1.1**), or a membrane with a fixed protein (**case 1.2.1**), 
we should derive surfaces using `atoms` of reference that fall in the
same unit cell. Here, we manage get those "extra" atoms from out of the
simulation box, back in the same primary unit cell via
[MDAnalysis.transformations.wrap]. 

By wrapping coordinates and keeping all our atoms of reference, we will
guarantee two important features in our calculation of membrane curvature:

- More atoms of reference in the primary unit cell. In other words, the
  `AtomGroup` of reference used to derive the surface will have more `atoms`,
  and thefore the surface will be derived from a highger number of points. 
- As a consequence, our grid will be more populated. Less empty cells in the
  grid means we will avoid annoying `np.nans` and our gradients (curvature)
  won't be driven by undefined values.
  Altogether, we will improve our sampling!


These considerations have been brought up during the development of the
[MDAnalysis] `MembraneCurvature` tool thanks to the active discussions with my
group of mentors. In the next post, I will discuss in detail the considerations
for the systems with proteins diffusing in the membrane.
